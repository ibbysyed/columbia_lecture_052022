#here's an interesting interview question that I've asked before in data engineering interviews: 

'''
The premise behind it is that the user should be able to take an event stream and understand how to create tables from it

Assume you have a payload that needs to be loaded into a database, 
as listed below. Thousandss records are entered into the database every hour, 
and you want to transform the data into a series of tables in a SQL database that 
are normalized and can be processed quickly and efficiently. 
Give a detailed explanation  on how you would split up the data, 
and how each table would look. Assume you have access to hash functions.

payload =

I won't actually outline the right answer here (there isn't just one) but the things you want to look
for include whether or not they notice the "additional answers" payload is a list of questions, and how
they would handle joining the data together (creating reference keys)
